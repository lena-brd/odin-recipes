    <p>
      This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise.
      You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to
      go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Proof the yeast: Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty
        stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5
        minutes until the yeast is dissolved. After 5 minutes stir if the yeast
        hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom,
        indicating that the yeast is still active and alive. (Note that if you
        are using "instant yeast" instead of "active yeast", no proofing is
        required. Just add to the flour in the next step.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Make and knead the pizza dough: Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive
        oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a
        minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.
        Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about
        7 to 10 minutes. If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients
        together and knead them by hand. The dough should be a little sticky or
        tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the dough rise: Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of
        a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so
        that it gets coated with the oil. At this point you can choose how long
        you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in
        the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick
        fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise
        sufficiently to work with. Cover the dough with plastic wrap. For a
        quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75°F to 85°F) for 1 1/2
        hours. For a medium rise, place the dough in a regular room temperature
        place (your kitchen counter will do fine) for 8 hours. For a longer
        rise, chill the dough in the refrigerator for 24 hours (no more than 48
        hours). The longer the rise (to a point) the better the flavor the crust
        will have.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the pizza stone (or pizza pan or baking sheet): Place a pizza
        stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat the oven to
        475°F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour. If you don't have a
        pizza stone, you can use a pizza pan or a thick baking sheet; you need
        something that will not warp at high temperatures.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the dough into 2 balls: Remove the plastic cover from the dough.
        Dust your hands with flour and push the dough down so it deflates a bit.
        Divide the dough in half. Form 2 round balls of dough. Place each in its
        own bowl, cover with plastic, and let sit for 15 minutes (or up to 2
        hours).
      </li>
      <li>
        Prep the toppings: Prepare your desired toppings. Note that you are not
        going to want to load up each pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust
        will end up not crisp that way. About a third a cup each of tomato sauce
        and cheese would be sufficient for one pizza. One to two mushrooms
        thinly sliced will cover a pizza.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flatten the dough ball, and stretch out into a round: Working one ball
        of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and flatten it with your
        hands on a lightly floured work surface. Starting at the center and
        working outwards, use your fingertips to press the dough to 1/2-inch
        thick. Turn and stretch the dough until it will not stretch further. Let
        the dough relax 5 minutes and then continue to stretch it until it
        reaches the desired diameter—10 to 12 inches. Treat the dough gently!
        You can also hold up the edges of the dough with your fingers, letting
        the dough hang and stretch, while working around the edges of the dough.
        If a hole appears in your dough, place the dough on a floured surface
        and push the dough back together to seal the hole. Use your palm to
        flatten the edge of the dough where it is thicker. Pinch the edges if
        you want to form a lip.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush the dough top with olive oil: Use your fingertips to press down
        and make dents along the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Brush
        the top of the dough with olive oil (to prevent it from getting soggy
        from the toppings). Let rest another 10 to 15 minutes. Repeat with the
        second ball of dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the pizza peel with cornmeal, put flattened dough on top:
        Lightly sprinkle your pizza peel (or flat baking sheet) with cornmeal.
        (The cornmeal will act as little ball bearings to help move the pizza
        from the pizza peel into the oven.) Transfer one prepared flattened
        dough to the pizza peel. If the dough has lost its shape in the
        transfer, lightly shape it to the desired dimensions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread with tomato sauce and sprinkle with toppings: Spoon on the tomato
        sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place your desired toppings on the
        pizza. Be careful not to overload the pizza with too many toppings, or
        your pizza will be soggy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slide pizza into the oven: Sprinkle some cornmeal on the baking stone in
        the oven (watch your hands, the oven is hot!). Gently shake the peel to
        see if the dough will easily slide; if not, gently lift up the edges of
        the pizza and add a bit more cornmeal. Slide the pizza off the peel and
        onto the baking stone in the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake: Bake pizza in the 475°F oven, one at a time, until the crust is
        browned and the cheese is golden, about 10 to 15 minutes. If you want,
        toward the end of the cooking time, you can sprinkle on a little more
        cheese.
