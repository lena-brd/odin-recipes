    <p>It is packed with berries and no mixer required.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Nonstick cooking spray</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups fresh or frozen blueberries</li>
      <li>2 cups (240g) plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, divided</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups (250g) plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, divided</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 cup milk, 2% preferred</li>
      <li>1/2 cup canola oil</li>
      <li>Finely grated zest of 1 medium lemon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with a parchment
        paper sling. Grease the parchment and pan with nonstick cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prep the blueberries: In a small bowl, toss the blueberries with 1
        tablespoon flour. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the batter: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the remaining 2
        cups flour, 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and
        salt. Add the eggs, milk, oil, and lemon zest to the flour mixture. Mix
        until just incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with blueberries and sugar: Pour the batter into the prepared baking
        pan. Arrange the blueberries on top and sprinkle evenly with the
        remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake: Bake the cake until the edges are golden brown and a toothpick
        inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 37 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool, slice, and serve: Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Use
        the parchment sling to transfer the cake to a wire rack to cool
        completely, about 1 hour. Slice and serve. Store leftovers in an
        airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.
      </li>
    </ol>
